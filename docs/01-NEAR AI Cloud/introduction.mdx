NEAR AI Cloud is the platform where AI runs on your terms — fully private, verifiable, and user-owned. 
Deploy and scale powerful language models on TEE-enabled GPUs with on-chain guarantees. Built for the 
age of agentic AI, NEAR AI Cloud gives your models the power to act, reason, and transact — while you 
retain complete control over the stack.

NEAR AI Cloud provides:

- **Unified API for AI Models**: Access leading AI models like DeepSeek, Llama, OpenAI, Qwen and more through a single API
- **Private Inference**: All AI computations run in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) ensuring end-to-end privacy and verifiability
- **Flexible Payments**: Top up or pay as you go
