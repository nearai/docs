**Run AI models with complete privacy.** NEAR AI Cloud delivers verifiable private inference through hardware-enforced security, giving you access to leading AI models without compromising your data. Built on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and blockchain verification, your computations remain private, tamper-proof, and under your control.

## Why NEAR AI Cloud?

## Why Trusted Execution Environments?

Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are encrypted secure areas inside CPUs and GPUs that run code and process data in complete isolation. Think of them as secure vaults within the hardware itself.

**What makes TEEs secure:**
- **Isolated Processing**: Data inside the TEE cannot be seen by the host OS, other applications, or even cloud infrastructure providers
- **Tamper-Proof**: Code and data inside the TEE cannot be modified or intercepted
- **Verifiable**: You can cryptographically verify that the TEE is genuine and model requests are processed in that secure environment.

## Your Data Stays Yours

With NEAR AI Cloud, your data remains truly private. Model providers, cloud infrastructure providers, and NEAR itself cannot see, access, mine, or use your data to train models. You get the power of leading AI models — like DeepSeek, Llama, OpenAI, and Qwen — with absolute confidence in your data privacy.
