# Private Inference

When you use traditional AI services, your data passes through systems controlled by cloud providers and AI companies. Your prompts, the AI's responses, and even the processing of your requests are all visible to these third parties. This creates serious security concerns for sensitive applications.

**Private inference solves this problem.** It ensures that AI computations happen in a completely isolated environment where no one—not the cloud provider, not the model provider, not even NEAR AI can access your data. At the same time, you can independently verify that your requests were actually processed in this secure environment through cryptographic attestation.

This guide explains how NEAR AI Cloud implements private inference using Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), the architecture that protects your data, and the security guarantees you can rely on.

## What is Private Inference?

Private inference is a method of running AI models where both your input data and the model's outputs remain completely hidden from everyone except the user and client even while the computation happens on remote servers you don't control.

Traditional cloud AI services require you to trust that providers won't access your data. Private inference eliminates this need for trust by using hardware-based security that makes it technically impossible for anyone to see your data, even with physical access to the servers.

NEAR AI Cloud's private inference provides three core guarantees:

## How Private Inference Works

### Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)

NEAR AI Cloud combines Intel TDX and NVIDIA TEE technologies to create isolated, secure environments for AI computation:

-  **[Intel TDX(Trust Domain Extensions)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/trust-domain-extensions/overview.html)** :
    Creates confidential virtual machines (CVMs) that isolate your AI workloads from the host system, preventing unauthorized access to data in memory.

- **[NVIDIA TEE](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/solutions/confidential-computing/)** :
    Provides GPU-level isolation for model inference, ensuring model weights and computations remain completely private during processing.

- **[Cryptographic Attestation](/cloud/verification)** :
    Each TEE environment generates cryptographic proofs of its integrity and configuration, enabling independent verification of the secure execution environment.

### Client-Side Encryption

If you're using a standard OpenAI SDK or curl, your prompts are automatically protected by TLS encryption—no additional setup required.

    style C fill:#2e7d32,stroke:#81c784,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff
```

**Key insight:** TLS termination happens inside the TEE (green box), not at an external load balancer. Your prompts remain encrypted until they reach the secure enclave.

Here's why this works:

1. **Standard HTTPS = TLS encryption**: When you make API calls using the OpenAI SDK or curl, you're connecting via HTTPS. This means TLS encryption is applied automatically by your client before any data leaves your machine.

2. **TLS terminates inside the TEE**: Unlike traditional cloud services where TLS terminates at an external load balancer, NEAR AI Cloud terminates TLS connections **inside the Trusted Execution Environment**. Your encrypted data travels from your laptop directly into the secure enclave before being decrypted.

3. **No plaintext exposure**: Because TLS termination happens within the TEE, your prompts are never exposed in plaintext outside the hardware-secured environment—not to network infrastructure, not to cloud providers, not to anyone.

This means you get the same seamless developer experience as any OpenAI-compatible API, while your data remains encrypted from your machine all the way into the secure TEE.

### The Inference Process

When you make a request to NEAR AI Cloud, your data flows through a secure pipeline designed to maintain privacy at every step:

    1. **Request Initiation:**
    You send chat completion requests via HTTPS to the LLM Gateway. TLS encryption protects your data in transit, and the TLS connection terminates inside the TEE, ensuring your prompts are decrypted only within the secure environment.

    2. **Secure Request Routing:**
    The LLM Gateway routes your request to the appropriate Private LLM Node based on the requested model, availability, and load balancing requirements.

    3. **Secure Inference:**
    AI inference computations execute inside the Private LLM Node's TEE, where all data and model weights are protected by hardware-enforced isolation.

    4. **Attestation Generation**
    The TEE generates CPU and GPU attestation reports that provide cryptographic proof of the environment's integrity and configuration.

    5. **Cryptographic Signing:**
    The TEE cryptographically signs both your original request and the inference results to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.

    6. **Verifiable Response:**
    You receive the AI response along with cryptographic signatures and attestation data for independent verification.

## Architecture Overview

NEAR AI Cloud operates through a distributed architecture consisting of an LLM Gateway and a network of Private LLM Nodes.

### Private LLM Nodes

Each Private LLM Node provides secure, isolated AI inference capabilities:

- **Standardized Hardware**: 8x NVIDIA H200 GPUs per node, optimized for high-performance inference
- **Intel TDX-enabled CPUs**: Enable secure virtualization with hardware-enforced isolation
- **Private-ML-SDK**: Manages secure model execution, attestation generation, and cryptographic signing
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated liveness checks and monitoring ensure continuous availability

### LLM Gateway

The LLM Gateway serves as the central orchestration layer:

- **Model Management**: Registers and manages available models across the Private LLM Node network
- **Request Routing**: Intelligently routes requests to appropriate nodes based on model availability and load
- **Attestation Verification**: Validates and stores TEE attestation reports for audit and verification
- **Access Control**: Manages API keys, authentication, and usage tracking for billing and monitoring

## Security Guarantees

### Defense in Depth

NEAR AI Cloud's private inference implements multiple layers of security to protect your data:

-  **Hardware-Level Isolation** :
  TEEs create isolated execution environments enforced at the hardware level, preventing unauthorized access to memory and computation even from privileged system administrators or cloud providers.

- **Secure Communication** :
All communication between your applications and the LLM infrastructure uses TLS encryption. Critically, TLS termination occurs inside the TEE—not at an external load balancer—so your prompts remain encrypted until they reach the secure enclave.

- **Cryptographic Attestation** :
Every TEE environment generates cryptographic proofs that verify the integrity of the execution environment, allowing you to independently confirm your computations occurred in a genuine, unmodified TEE.

- **Result Authentication** :
All AI outputs are cryptographically signed inside the TEE before leaving the secure environment, ensuring the authenticity and integrity of responses.

### Threat Protection

NEAR AI Cloud's architecture protects against common attack vectors:

- **Malicious Infrastructure Providers** :
Hardware-enforced TEE isolation prevents cloud infrastructure providers from accessing your prompts, model weights, or inference results, even with physical access to servers.

- **Network-Based Attacks** :
End-to-end encryption protects your data during transmission, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and network eavesdropping.

- **Model Extraction Attempts** :
Model weights remain encrypted and isolated within the TEE, making extraction computationally infeasible even for attackers with privileged system access.

**Result Tampering** :
Cryptographic signatures generated inside the TEE ensure that responses cannot be modified in transit without detection, maintaining the integrity of AI outputs.
