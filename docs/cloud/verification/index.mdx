[NEAR AI Cloud](https://cloud.near.ai) operates in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) which use cryptographic proofs to verify that your private AI conversations actually happened in secure, isolated environments that are not on compromised systems or with unauthorized access.

This section will show you step-by-step processes for checking these proofs, validating digital signatures, and confirming that your AI interactions haven't been tampered with.

:::tip 
See an easy-to-follow example implementation in the [NEAR AI Cloud Verification Example](https://github.com/near-examples/nearai-cloud-verification-example) repo.

A more complete verifier implementation is available in the [NEAR AI Cloud Verifier](https://github.com/nearai/nearai-cloud-verifier) repo.

## How NEAR AI Cloud Verification Works

1. **Secure Key Generation:** When NEAR AI Cloud initializes, it generates a unique cryptographic signing key pair inside the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The private key never leaves the secure hardware.

2. **Hardware Attestation:** The system generates attestation reports that cryptographically prove it's running on genuine NVIDIA H100/H200/B100 hardware in TEE mode within a confidential VM.

3. **Key Binding:** These attestation reports include the public key from step 1, creating a verifiable link between the secure hardware and the signing capability.

4. **Message Signing:** Every AI inference request and response is digitally signed using the private key that remains secured within the TEE.

5. **End-to-End Verification:** You can verify that your AI interactions were genuinely processed in the secure environment by:

    - Checking the hardware attestation reports
    - Validating the digital signatures on your messages
    - Confirming the signing key matches the attested hardware
